# German-Credit-Risk-Modelling
this is project is a part of my Machine Learning Projects. 
Machine learning is a extensive process. I was just trying to explorer some of the algorithms like Gaussian Naive Bayes, KNearestNeighbours, Logistic regression, Support Vector Machine, etc.
Self learning is tiresome process. I'm trying my best to find out my erros and correcting them
